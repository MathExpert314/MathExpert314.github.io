man, this is some madness in my headphones, they're Stereo, these headphones are full of STEREO MADNESS. oh god! 
the trains off the rails! i hope we can get it BACK ON TRACK, but it's also quite DRY OUTside. also, in minecraft, 
i keep building bases! it's just base after BASE AFTER BASE, so on, but i just CANT LET GO of this habit! Bunnies 
are cute. they're little JUMPERs, and remember that one phineas and ferb episode where they made a TIME MACHINE? how 
many CYCLES does this washing machine do? and i'm doing algebra, i'm on the X STEP, also, have you heard of this one 
Disco? it's cluttered and funky, it's all just a big CLUTTER FUNK. and it was really cool that einstein was trying 
to make a THEORY OF EVERYTHING. there's a new show where this guy called the Electroman goes on adventures, it's 
some really cool ELECTROMAN ADVENTURES, i once played baseball with a club and i was running around with the CLUB 
STEPping. also i was trying to learn kinetic energy and stuff and i just thought of something like ELECTRO DYNAMICS, 
also i found a stop sign shaped like a hexagon, it was a pretty cool, almost like a HEXAGON FORCE. I was once in 
chernobyl, i found a remnant of the blast, it took a while, but people could tell i was BLAST PROCESSING, also, 
einstien if he was still alive, would make a THEORY OF EVERYTHING TWO. there was one time where i was the best in 
Geometry Class, and they called me the GEOMETRICAL DOMINATOR! Also, my cat sadly died, but we locked them up and 
they're now DEADLOCKED. also, when i play some games or i'm typing, my fingers dash on the keyboard like they're 
doing a FINGERDASH, and also, i was late to school one time so i had to DASH there. i also once had a suprise 
math test, it was like THE CHALLENGE of my life! i went into the Burj Khalifa once, it was THE TOWER i always wanted 
to visit i also once had to go into THE SEWERS because i lost something in there (overkill, i know), for that i 
went to jail for a day and i saw THE CELLAR that they had, and did you know that [THE jail bars are SECRETly HOLLOW]
