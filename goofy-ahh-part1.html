  <h1>The Nether Showdown: Mario vs. Doof vs. Shrek (featuring confusion)</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Universe 1: The Mushroom Kingdom</h2>
    <p class="narration">Mario was enjoying his daily practice of punching bricks with his forehead and yelling "WAHOO!" when the sky opened like a ravioli. A swirling vortex sucked him in mid-jump, right as he yelled,</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Let’s-a gaaaaaaaaAAAAAAH—"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Universe 2: Tri-State Area</h2>
    <p class="narration">Dr. Doofenshmirtz had just finished building his latest “-inator”:</p>
    <p class="dialogue">“The Spontaneous Random Combatant Summoner-inator™”</p>
    <p class="narration">He turned to Dug, who was wearing a lab coat for no reason, and said,</p>
    <p class="dialogue">“With this, I can summon someone to fight Perry the Platypus FOR ME!”</p>
    <p class="narration">The machine exploded into a portal, sucking them both in.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Dug: “I was promised walkies...”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Universe 3: Far Far Away</h2>
    <p class="narration">Shrek and Donkey were arguing about onion rings when a glowing red Nether portal erupted from their outhouse and sucked them in mid-banter.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Shrek: “SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD MEEEE—!”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Nether - The Lava-Filled Cage Match Arena</h2>
    <p class="narration">Mario ground-pounded a Magma Cube. Doof and Dug landed on a floating obsidian rock. Shrek and Donkey rode in on a flaming Ghast.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Shrek: “Why are we in Minecraft Hell?”</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Donkey: “I don’t know, but I’m about to clap some plumber cheeks.”</p>
    <h3>Round One: Total Chaos</h3>
    <p class="narration">Mario blasted fireballs. Shrek ate one and burped lava. Dug entered HyperFetch Mode. Donkey threw a Nether wart that exploded into sound effects. It was insane.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Doof: “MY SCIENTIFICALLY AVERAGE KNEES!”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Enter: Kris and Susie (Deltarune)</h2>
    <p class="narration">Kris and Susie walk through a calm portal. Susie stares at the madness.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">“What the hell is this lava Thunderdome?”</p>
    <p class="narration">They see Shrek yeet a Blaze, Mario and Donkey fistfighting on a strider, and Dug glowing like a god-dog.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Susie: “Best. Sidequest. Ever.”</p>

    <h2>Epilogue: Peanut Butter Surf Session 5000</h2>

    <p class="dialogue">Mario: “MAMMA MIA!”</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Doof: “DUG. We are starting the FIRST EVER PEANUT BUTTER SURFING LEAGUE.”</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Dug: “I do not know what surfing is, but I love you.”</p>
    <p class="narration">They surf the peanut butter sea as flaming banjo skeletons play Free Bird.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Shrek: “...Is it just me or is this kind of beautiful?”</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Susie: “I’m not dealing with this crap.”</p>
